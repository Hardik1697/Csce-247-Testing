# Csce-247-Testing
### About:
#### This is the repo that contains test classes for our final project repo: https://github.com/Hardik1697/CSCE-247-Final-Project-Implementation-And-Testing.
#### There are some important pre-conditions to ensure proper testing which are listed below.

### Pre-conditions for Testing:
#### Please do not add/remove/modify data from any json file. If you do so, the tests written for the Data classes will fail.
#### The Data classes directly take input from the respective json file, and if modified, the data loaded into the test methods will from vary what we have built the test method for, and hence, result in failing.
#### The modified data will result into maually entering the data into the test classes, as the tests load the data from the json files.
